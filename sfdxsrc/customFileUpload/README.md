# Custom File Upload Using Lightning Web Component

We have created a Component that will upload the file under the file object instead of Attachment. The reason we are doing, Salesforce is deprecating the attachments. and this components have the ability to upload the files using Lightning Web Component

## Usage
To use this component use the component inside any parent component or you can use this component as independent.

```
<c-upload-file record-id="record id here"></c-upload-file>
```

- recordId : Pass the Record id under which you wanted to upload the file

## Limitations
- Can upload the file upto 5-6 MB only
